This is a getopt_long() replacement that I use when I'm writing code
that needs to be portable to non-Unix environments (i.e. Windows).

cmdline uses a different organization, making use of callbacks instead
of having a function invoked repeatedly. This permits the API to be
called recursively, e.g. if an init file is named explicitly in argv.

The code also provides an API for parsing a single string into
argc/argv values, allowing for such things as accepting multiple
arguments via an environment variable.
